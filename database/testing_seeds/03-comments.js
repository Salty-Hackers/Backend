        comment: "Im calling BS. I stopped reading after you wrote about Nazi Soldiers and Soviet Soldiers because that was the point I was sure you are a fool. Specifically gems like, Nazi soldiers as not only dishonorable, but downright evil and unless we are willing to defend the Soviet soldier, who dutifully executed the orders of Stalin, we cannot pardon the American soldier show how little you understand about the realities of life under FascistDespotic rule. I certainly dont want to be an apologist for the terrible atrocities crafted and committed by the men on the ground of a war, but your stance is naive. You seem to have imagined-up to yourself Evil armies, populated solely by Evil men who could not wait to murder, rape, and torture. Then you conclude, You are a soldier fighting for evil men, therefore you are evil. This is inaccurate. The sad truth is a majority of Nazi and Soviet soldiers were average people and not that different from you or I. Almost none of these soldiers had any choice in the matter to fight for these Tyrannical Leaders. Both armies were populated mainly through conscriptions and drafts. In fact (and through my Russian family members, I know this to be true), you were guaranteed to be executed (and your family) if you did not join the army and serve obediently. And you do not seem to understand the importance of Moral leadership, military and governmental, to the morality of the troops. What happens when youre ordered, under pain-of-death, to execute an evil order? You can resist, for which you are either executed immediately or more likely disappeared without the opportunity to be a martyr to inspire your comrades. Do not forget, your family will also meet the same fate: e.g. Stalins Order 270. This environment eliminates the effect and actions of good men by killing them, corrupting them, or cowing them to the point of compliance. Admittedly, I could only stomach the first few sections of your writing. But that was enough to offend me with your lack of understanding of history and humanity. Its easy sit in your comfy world, with freedom and a democratic government and call those poor souls Evil, Dishonorable, etc. You have these gifts out of dumb luck. If you were born in some other time or land without those gifts, you would likely find yourself walking in their shoes doing the things they did. That is sad and terrifying, but likely true. There are bad men that serve in the American Military. But most of them are very normal people and a significant portion of them serve with honor. Our military is volunteer, which means the members had a choice to be there. In addition, our governmental and military leaders are moral for the most part. That makes it radically different from these Boogey-Man Armies youre equating them with. You are comparing Apples to Oranges and doing a rather terrible job at it.",

        comment: "I am saddened that I have post this anonymously, but there is still a lot of stigma regarding mental health. Much of what the author says about the psych ward aligns with my limited experience as a patient, but, please, if you are suicidal, delusional, manic, uncontrollably angry, or paranoid, check yourself into the nearest emergency room. Even if you do not think you are threat, you can still physically harm yourself or others if you do not seek help. I speak from experience. The psych ward is there to get you stabilized and get attention quickly. But in my, again limited, experience, the state of inpatient psych treatment in the US is terrible, especially given the cost. If you want anecdotal evidence that something is deeply wrong with our health care system, try spending a week in a psych ward. But it is all we have right now, and spending time in the psych ward is still better than harming yourself. Sadly the outpatient system isnt much better. In many cities there is a chronic lack of psychiatrists. I think many Drs have become jaded by the number of patients requesting treatment and can overlook more serious cases. Also, in my opinion, too many psychiatrists have become prescribers and not involved enough with their patients therapy. In which case they can loose touch with the effects of the medication being prescribed. I am Bipolar Type II, and, while treatable, it can be a very dangerous illness. It can wreak havoc with your life and the life of others.",

        comment: "I dont know if percentages are the right metric to use here. You can certainly make up a scenario which is completely absurd, but still has your percentages. Assume 100,000,000 green people, and 100 blue people on a distant planet. Nine blue criminals kill 9 blue people. One green person kills one blue person. So thats 90% blue-on-blue murder, and an 10% of the blue population are murderers, and there is a 10% murder rate among the blue population. Now lets say there were there were 9 green people murdered by 9 green people, and one 1 green person murdered by 1 blue person. Again 90% green-on-green murder, and a 0.00000001% murder rate.",

        comment: "Fuck I hate you pathetic liberal morons. This is an intentional leakhack by the new world order to demonise males and suffuse the media with leftist, feminist nonsense. The usual libtard useless eaters will lap it up and of course ignore the government destroying all our rights, murdering hundreds of thousands in the middle east, funding ISIS and Al Qaeda, persecuting whistleblowers and passing the TPPA which give immense powers to bankers and corporations over western countries. Women are so entitled, when they cheat suddenly its the mans fault. Let me educate you liberal idiots about feminism, youve all been duped, its a political social engineering psy-op. Real women realise that feminism these days is nonsense. Its actually social engineering by the central bankingcorporate oligarchy that control the western governments and the media to make society weaker, and more easy to control and manipulate. Classic divide and conquer. Masculinise women and feminise men, empower women, subjugate men, and confuse the gender roles to make malefemale relationships hard to form as men have evolved to compliment and protect women, not compete with them, marriage is at an all-time low as a result. This male feminisation and subjugation weakens men who are more likely to challenge authority and are physically much more of a threat to authority and also destroys the family, the primary goal.\nFamily provides social cohesion and resistance to tyranny, thus they must destroy the family and divide society. They cannot tolerate devotion to family before the state. The same principle applies to why theyve orchestrated such a massive anti-religion campaign in the media and popular culture, the power elite cannot tolerate devotion to a God before the state, especially a God that promotes individual rights, family values and absolute morality. Im not religious but I recognise social engineering propaganda when I see it. So recognise the people behind all of this, the militant deluded, poisonous feminists are puppet dupes, as are the media and even the politicians. The real villains are the central banking power elite, Rothschild, Rockefella, Kissinger, Morgan, brzezinski and such people. The owners of the Federal reserve and the people behind the IMF World Bank and the BIS (Bank of International Settlements) are the ones behind the majority of the worlds problems, war, financial collapse toxins, viruses etc as they enter the endgame of their plan for world government in which they create chaos and division to offer up their world government as the solution. Another key aspect stemming from the destruction of the family and the forcing of women into the workplace via social feminist propaganda and economic manipulation is that children become raised by the State. They can get force fed constant establishment propaganda throughout their lives with a heavily reduced parental influence. Bottom line, theres a sinister political agenda at work designed to subvert gender roles, subjugate and disempower men and erode the family.",

        comment: "Its unlikely Google drops projects any more frequently than startups fail. I have (or have had) a lot of paperweights manufactured by failed startups, so I know it happens. Im sad when startups fail, but they usually failed for the right reasons. It doesnt taint my overall perception of the startup concept. If you think the Nexus Q was a fantastic product and that Google made the wrong decision to kill it, thats one thing -- youre saying they have bad taste, or bad product sense, or an inverted sense of quality vs. crap. I wouldnt agree with that assessment, though I admit its an valid, internally consistent opinion. But its more likely you never owned a Nexus Q and are just using it as an example of how projects at Google get killed. Sure, Google kills projects. Just as startups fail. Thats no more astute an observation than saying that sometimes its sunny and sometimes it rains. You wouldnt expect Google to keep funding a stalled or not-quite-thriving project any more than youd expect investors to keep plowing money into a startup that cant find product-market fit. Sure, the opposite outcome sometimes happens. But generally it doesnt, and thats OK. Some think Google is valuable because it takes more risks than companies its size. The implication of your opinion is the opposite -- that Google should be more risk-averse (not starting this router project because a router is a crazy thing to build), or innovate more slowly (launching it later than today because its not ready), or ignore market feedback longer than a startup would (damn the torpedoes, it sucks and nobody wants it, but lets keep its team on a death march). Is that how youd run Google if you were its CEO?",
